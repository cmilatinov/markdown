This payload design has the scientific community as the priority stakeholders.
This design can be used by student clubs designing CubeSats to launch yeast experiments into space.
Other research based groups such as AstroYeast will benefit from this design as they will be able to
study different yeast strains in space for an affordable price. Furthermore, the results from these
experiments will benefit all of humanity as they may pave the way for better waste management techniques
medicine, and construction materials.

Some of the competitors for this project include: Space Agencies that provide custom space experiment
platforms, NanoRacks which provides a testing platform aboard the International Space Station, and
pharmaceutical companies capable of financing the design and development of a space experiment platform for
medical solutions.
